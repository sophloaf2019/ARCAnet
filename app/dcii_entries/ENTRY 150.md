# DCII ENTRY 150
## SUBJECT 1
**Classification**: Item (Anomalous Electronic)

**Containment Status**: Contained

**Danger/Probability**: 4/2

**Restriction**: Sensitive

**Description**: Subject 1 is an 128GB SD card from the company SanDisk. It is damaged, having been chewed by presumably a dog and then either stepped on or run over by some sort of vehicle. The card is non-functional. It is too bent to plug it into an SD card reader, and attempting to read the contents by any other means does not work -- the host computer never recognizes the SD card as a valid drive.

Individuals in the presence or contact of the SD card report mild to severe feelings of anxiety, discomfort, dread, and stomachaches. This effect is heightened depending on the individual's demographics.

Currently, based on collected data, the card seems to affect...

- Women
- Young adults aged 18-25
- Those with children
- Those who work with children
- Traditional artists of any kind (poets, painters, instrumentalists)
- Anyone wearing a color collectively agreed upon as "beige"

...more strongly than others. The only individuals who reported no feelings of dread were those that were on high dosage anti-anxiety medication or were sociopathic/psychopathic.

The subject will still cause feelings of dread even if the individual does not know about the SD card's presence. It is not hindered by or prevented with physical barriers and exudes these emotions at a range of up to about 20 feet. Touching Subject 1 exacerbates the feelings greatly, often leading to a panic attack or fight-or-flight response within seconds.

Naturally, the Department has investigated potential causes. Subject 1 is not enchanted or cursed, nor is it <confidential>psychically imbued</confidential>, nor does it harbor any technology on the interior besides a broken microchip. The individual pieces of Subject 1 still cause these sensations at no loss of severity or strength. 

It was received in the mail at DCII's Dallas site, from an anonymous sender. The letter only contained a small note with a scrawled message (see **FOOTNOTE 150-1**) and a badly damaged SD card.

Currently, Subject 1 resides in a small foam-lined plastic container in the center of a mostly empty room in the basement of the Dallas site. A sign on the door is posted as a warning to those heading inside. **FOOTNOTE 150-2** contains the full text.

# FOOTNOTE 150-1
A translation of the text of the note, written hastily in black ink on a torn quarter of FIVESTAR lined paper (typos are intentional):

<confidential>"I just gotta get it out of my house

I'm so sorry I wish I cuould change the past

those kids deserve better then me"
</confidential>

# FOOTNOTE 150-2
The sign posted on the door in the basement of the DCII Dallas site, where Subject 1 is held, reads as follows:

to those around it.

if you begin feeling extremely distressed.
