# DCII ENTRY 422
## SUBJECT 1
**Classification**: Item (Enchanted, <classified>Haunted</classified> Vehicle)

**Containment Status**: Missing

**Danger/Probability**: 1/1

**Restriction**: Sensitive

**Description**: Subject 1 is an RV (or motor home) of unknown make and model. It was acquired on 2016-02-12 after an ARCA agent purchased it from a police auction. 

The RV is white and and beige on the exterior. By appearances, it seems to be from the 90s, with yellowing paint and rust. The owner's log inside corroborates this claim, indicating its first owner (or its first owner who started the log) did so on 1999-08-26. 

The RV has a plethora of features, some magical, some anomalous. These features were added by the owners over the years.

The standard features of the RV (like its length, weight, and whatnot) and all items inside are available in **DOCUMENT 422-1**, but these features are outside the scope of this article.

To elaborate on the "unknown make and model" -- the exterior and interior of the RV, and all electronics, manufactured components, and other pieces involved lack branding and any kind of serial numbers. The RV does not match any descriptions or features of any known RVs available today. No experienced outdoors-people have been able to identify the RV. As such, the DCII considers it an "unknown make or model", and the matter is considered to be not urgent in any sort and a waste of organization resources.

### Robert Strasinksi
The first owner of the RV was Robert Strasinksi. Noted in the owner's log as R. Strasinksi, he purchased the RV from an unknown seller in his home town in Nebraska. As Robert passed before the investigation took place, our information is limited, and it was never written who he bought it from, why, or where.

He was, by all appearances, an experienced spellcaster and manipulator of reality. In his owner logs, he details some changes he made over the course of his ownership from 1999-08-26 to 2000-08-17.

Some of the changes are simple maintenance, like a brake check, oil change, and headlight replacement. One major change stands out, though: the interior of the RV had a solid oak door installed, separating the "residential" section from the driving cab. The door is accompanied by a mechanical switch. 

Through the use of spatial magic not yet understood, the door leads to a space that is larger than the RV it is contained in. This space features a rather comfortable common room, two small bedrooms, a bathroom, and a kitchen laundry combo. It is built to resemble typical RV furnishings, with somewhat cheap materials and flooring, but it spacious and comfortable all the same. 

Individuals inside this "extra space" often report that, in spite of the comfort, warm lighting, and cushions, the space feels "a little oppressive" and "deafening". Obviously, no sound is being played anywhere in the room, but the lack of windows and potential side effects of spatial manipulation magic can cause a strange sensation of claustrophobia. 

One researcher from ARCA postulates that humans can actually detect the edge of whatever universe they're in; since the pocket dimension is its own universe with the edge so close to the dwellers, it leads to a sense of anxiety. This is merely a theory. 

If the switch is flipped to the off position, the pocket dimension vanishes and the door leads to the interior of the RV, like normal. The switch has no function if the door is open, and must be re-flipped when the door is properly shut. The door locks from the extraspatial side, but there is no switch on the interior. Time still passes as normal, according to testing, with deviation up to but not necessarily 1 second per hour. 

Trying to access the standard interior of the RV while the switch is on, or trying to break out of the extraspatial zone, and other sorts of "what if" situations are considered undefined behavior. It is unknown what happens in these cases, and testing them is considered a bad idea. The outcome could be something as simple as the extraspatial zone collapsing indefinitely, or could lead to a rupture in our spacetime fabric. 

It should also be noted that Robert included a note saying the RV was <classified>haunted</classified>. It's presumed this is the reason it was sold in the first place. Robert notes some frustrations with <classified>the ghost, saying it rots food if you're not looking and clangs on pipes in the engine</classified>.
### Alan Baker
Robert sold the RV, including its magical modifications, to Alan Baker on 2000-08-17. 

Alan Baker's ownership was entirely standard. He visited some landmarks, like Seqouia National Park, Yosemite, and other places. 

### Donna Tanner
Donna bought the RV from Alan on 2008-09-03. She, like Robert, was a magic user. She noted that she added some artifacts from her personal collection, namely the <confidential>"map of the sea"</confidential> and the <confidential>"compass of desire"</confidential>. She was not great at filling the log, only noting she was on "adventures" for great swaths of time. She unfortunately passed before the investigation as well, making it difficult to ascertain the truth of what she used it for. 

After she passed, it was sold in an estate sale. 

### The Mystic
An unnamed sorcerer bought it from the estate sale on 2012-12-20. They filled out the log with meticulous detail, but refused to identify themselves, only writing in as The Mystic. They added a <confidential>"mask of seer"</confidential> and <confidential>"seer stone"</confidential>, the <confidential>mask</confidential> on the back of the RV and the <confidential>stone</confidential> by the steering wheel. touching the <confidential>stone</confidential> enables you to see through the <confidential>mask's eyes</confidential>, causing it to function as backup camera. 

The Mystic also added a <confidential>"glossover"</confidential> diffuser system of copper piping, retrofitted the engine with an <confidential>alchemical quicksilver rune block</confidential>, started a small collection of magic herbs, and installed a foldable alchemical brewery kit.

The Mystic has also journaled that they have <classified>successfully befriended the ghost. By leaving out food and snacks, the ghost will "consume" the food by rapidly rotting or spoiling it. The identify of the ghost is entirely unknown, but The Mystic refers to it as the "girl in the walls". Apparently, the ghost is also capable of manipulating the steering wheel and gas pedal, allowing The Mystic to take a break from driving.</classified>

<classified>The Mystic makes it abundantly clear that they are not enslaving the ghost. They provide ample entertainment, conversation, and food, and respect no's and try not to push. The Mystic claims that Alan was particularly rude to the ghost, since the ghost cannot actually depart from the RV, but that their relationship has been healthy so far. The girl ghost apparently enjoys energy drinks, sour candies, and spicy chips. The food items are just discarded after the ghost is done with it.</classified>

The Mystic seemingly abandoned the vehicle a little bit before the date it was acquired -- 2016-01-04 is the date of the last log, in Sacramento -- and it sat for a while before the police dialed ARCA. ARCA passed it off to the DCII, who parked it in their LA site location. 

## SUBJECT 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
**Classification**: <confidential>Item (Enchanted Tool)</confidential>

**Containment Status**: <confidential>Missing</confidential>

**Danger/Probability**: <confidential>3/1</confidential>

**Restriction**: Confidential

**Description**: <confidential>Subjects 2-7 are the various items within the RV that deserve their own subject designations, but share a **Restriction** level and **Classification**.</confidential>

### SUBJECT 2
<confidential>Subject 2 is the "map of the sea". It displays the RV as a galleon, roads and parking lots as water, and destinations (like neighborhoods and large stores) show as islands with dramatized names (like the Club of Admiral Sam, for Sam's Club). The map is blank when opened and inks itself magically to show the immediate area. When it is closed, it erases itself. If the map is opened and then left alone, it may start to doodle sea monsters or other events on the world map. 

It responds to basic verbal commands, like "zoom out". If you are referring to a location on the map, you must use it's map name, not its real life name. 

The map scroll is stored under the driver seat. 

This item is definitely magical. People with zero magical aptitude cannot activate the map.</confidential>
### SUBJECT 3
<confidential>Subject 3 is the "compass of desire". It is brass, with a red and white needle and glass protective cover. Inside are two rows and ten columns of flip display characters, engraved in a hand-done but very fancy script. 

When you whisper the compass directions (using the map names to point to locations, if not using an actual address), the needle will spin rapidly and point you along the turns you need to make to get there. The 20 characters of text will change to represent instructions like EXIT 22B, RIGHT IN 1.5 MI, et cetera. If space permits, the last couple characters will show the remaining drivable distance, in whatever unit the user is most familiar with. 

If asked to point to a location the RV cannot reach or a location that doesn't exist, the needle will spin frantically for a few seconds and then slow down, and the text will display ERROR.

The compass is bolted to a small arm to the right of the driver's steering wheel. 

This item is also magical.</confidential>
### SUBJECT 4 
<confidential>Subject 4 is the "glossover" diffuser system. A series of thin pipes that extend through the walls of the cab around the exterior of the RV emit fumes of a plant that causes the "Psychic-induced Glossover Effect". This makes people less likely to notice the RV, especially when it's parked illegally. A small, manually-installed light switch activates a humidifer in the center console that powers the diffuser system.

The plant in question is unknown, as the tank located in the center console of the cab was empty upon acquisition.

The system is not inherently magical -- the plant extract they used is.</confidential>
### SUBJECT 5
<confidential>Subject 5 is the pair of seer items, the mask mounted to the back of the RV and the stone screwed to the left of the wheel. The mask is carved of granite, very roughly, and features holes for the eyes and the mouth. There is no indication that the mask is used or active, and the mouth doesn't function. The stone is also granite -- thought to be of the same source rock, no less -- and is entirely nondescript. 

Touching the stone causes you to see through the mask. Turning your head simulate a head turn in the mask, but the mask will not physically move. Moving has no effect on your perspective.

This is a magic item as well.</confidential>
### SUBJECT 6
<confidential>Subject 6 is the cash register. Much like the RV, it is of unknown make or model, featuring only small old-school buttons for $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. A faded label reads "BALANCE", and reports how much the register holds, maxing out at $100, using a flip-style display.

A dial points from 1 to 10. Selecting a number will cause that many bills to be dispensed, up to the available balance. The drawer will then open (which doesn't happen by any other means), containing only the bills chosen.

The bills, under analysis, look like bills from roughly 1950. The serial numbers are either that of pre-existing bills or are a digit short. The material the bill is printed on is legitimate, and there are no other clues the bill is a fake.

After roughly half an hour, the bill will dissipate as soon as it is no longer observed. Placing a bill under constant observation will extend this life span perhaps indefinitely. However, even a blink is enough time for it to vanish.</confidential>
### SUBJECT 7
<confidential>Subject 7 is the rune block in the engine bay. By pouring alchemical quicksilver over the runes, they activate, producing rotational power on a flywheel and generating torque. The alternator is still present and charges the battery, which only powers the electronics. A diagram of this machine is available upon request.</confidential>

## SUBJECT 8
**Classification**: <classified>Entity (Ghost)</classified>

**Containment Status**: <classified>Missing</classified>

**Danger/Probability**: <classified>6/1</classified>

**Restriction**: Classified

**Description**: <classified>Subjects 8 is the ghost that resides in the RV. The spirit belongs to (presumably) a young woman of about 20 years of age, from before the first owner's purchase. The ghost is best described as "catty", often causing frustrations for researchers and operators alike.

As noted, The Mystic was able to "tame" the ghost by offering food and reasoning with her, rather than letting the frustrations upset them. The ghost is capable of operating the vehicle and responds to pet names like "hun" or "girlie". 

The ghost is seemingly bound to the RV and is unable to leave. Researchers are encouraged to spend time with her at least once every four days, bringing some kind of snack or beverage and doing something entertaining, like reading a book aloud, watching a show with the volume set very high, or playing a board game. This practice should be limited to researchers who don't get irritated easily -- perhaps ones that are good with children.</classified>
